SafeAir Pro: Clean Air of Kazakhstan

SafeAir Pro is a digital platform for intelligent air quality monitoring, designed to ensure the environmental safety of Kazakhstan’s residents. The project combines modern web development technologies with environmental analytics to help protect public health.

Why is this important?
In the context of rapid industrial development, atmospheric monitoring has become critically important. SafeAir Pro transforms complex technical data into clear, actionable recommendations, enabling people to make informed decisions about their health in real time.

Key Features of the Project:
	•	Interactive Dashboard: Clear visualization of the AQI index, temperature, and humidity with geolocation integration (Karaganda).
	•	Smart Recommendations: The system automatically generates personalized advice for different groups (children, adults, people with chronic conditions) based on the current pollution level.
	•	Risk Analysis: Evaluation of weather conditions and air quality to determine the best time for outdoor activities.
	•	Eco-Motivation: Visualization of a user’s personal contribution to improving the region’s environmental condition.

Technological Foundation:
The platform is built using TypeScript and the React library, ensuring high performance and stability. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI are used to create a modern interface with seamless display across all devices.

SafeAir Pro — your personal shield in the world of ecology.
